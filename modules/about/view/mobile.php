Commander HQ has been designed with the express
purpose of giving athletes a convenient way to record workouts and measure
progress.

In addition to that this tool is also designed around adding
value to athletes and we have put together some additional elements that would
stimulate and encourage the great camaraderie we see amongst the CrossFit
community. Challenges are designed to be personal, and social and conducted on a
regular basis.

This service has been developed to connecting with Gym's
so that you have easy access to WOD's and to recording your progress. At the end
of a session all you, the athlete, will be required to do is input the results
of your WOD.

If you can't make it to Gym, no problem, do the WOD at
another location and record your results. If you want to set up your own
personal WOD, we cater for that as well as if you want to do a benchmark
activity - thats there too.

You can see your progress in fitness as we
track activities. Reports are based on the comparison between Benchmark
performance, Baseline performance and individual activities - you are able to
measure your increase in strength and fitness against specific activities.
